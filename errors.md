walk through the output of your Helm install command and troubleshoot the issues:

1. Warnings:
   ```
   W1010 17:02:30.886049   19816 warnings.go:70] spec.template.metadata.annotations[scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod]: non-functional in v1.16+; use the "priorityClassName" field instead
   ```
   - These warnings indicate that you're using an outdated annotation for pod scheduling.
   - To resolve: Update your values.yaml to use `priorityClassName` instead of the deprecated annotation.

2. Deployment Status:
   ```
   NAME: my-sck
   LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Oct 10 17:02:29 2024
   NAMESPACE: default
   STATUS: deployed
   REVISION: 1
   ```
   - This shows that the deployment was successful.

3. Main Warning:
   ```
   ##################################################################
   ####   WARN: You did not set splunk.hec.indexName correctly   ####
   ##################################################################
   ```
   - This is the primary issue you need to address.
   - The warning states that you're using the same index for metrics, logs, and objects, which is not recommended.
   - You have to go to the end of [[values.yaml]] where it says `splunk-kubernetes-metrics:`

```yaml
...SNIP...
splunk-kubernetes-metrics:
...SNIP...
  splunk:
    hec:
      host: "127.0.0.1"
      port: 8088
      token: <REDACTED>
      protocol: "http"
      fullUrl: null
      indexName: "splunk_metrics" # should only have the metrics where others should say `indexName: "k8s_logs,k8s_metadata"`
      insecureSSL: null
      clientCert: null
      clientKey: null
      caFile: null
      consume_chunk_on_4xx_errors: null
...SNIP...
```

4. Recommendation:
   ```
   Metrics collected by splunk-kubernetes-metrics are supposed to be indexed in
   a Metrics Index. But you are using the same index for metrics as for logs
   and/or objects. You should use splunk-kubernetes-metrics.splunk.hec.indexName
   to set index for metrics.
   ```
   - You need to create a separate Metrics Index in Splunk for your metrics data.

5. Next Steps:
   a. Create a Metrics Index in Splunk:
      - Follow the guide at: http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/Setupmultipleindexes#Create_metrics_indexes

   b. Update your values.yaml file:
      - Add or modify the `splunk-kubernetes-metrics.splunk.hec.indexName` field to specify your new Metrics Index.

   c. Upgrade your Helm release:
      - After making changes, run the suggested command:
        ```
        helm upgrade my-sck -f values.yaml splunk/splunk-connect-for-kubernetes
        ```

To resolve these issues:

1. Update your values.yaml file:
   - Remove any `scheduler.alpha.kubernetes.io/critical-pod` annotations.
   - Add appropriate `priorityClassName` fields if needed.
   - Set a separate Metrics Index for `splunk-kubernetes-metrics.splunk.hec.indexName`.

2. Create the necessary Metrics Index in your Splunk instance.

3. Run the Helm upgrade command to apply these changes.

4. After upgrading, check the status of your pods to ensure everything is running correctly:
   ```
   kubectl get pods
   ```

5. If you encounter any issues after the upgrade, check the logs of the relevant pods:
   ```
   kubectl logs <pod-name>
   ```

By following these steps, you should resolve the warnings and set up your Splunk Connect for Kubernetes correctly with separate indexes for metrics and logs/objects.
